/**
 * 1136. Parallel Courses
 * Medium
 *
 * You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei.
 *
 * In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semester for the courses you are taking.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. If there is no way to take all the courses, return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
 * In the first semester, you can take courses 1 and 2.
 * In the second semester, you can take course 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: No course can be studied because they are prerequisites of each other.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     1 <= n <= 5000
 *     1 <= relations.length <= 5000
 *     relations[i].length == 2
 *     1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n
 *     prevCoursei != nextCoursei
 *     All the pairs [prevCoursei, nextCoursei] are unique.
